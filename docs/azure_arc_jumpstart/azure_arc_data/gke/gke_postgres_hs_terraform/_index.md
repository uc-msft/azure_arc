## Deploy an Azure PostgreSQL Hyperscale Deployment on GKE using a Terraform plan

The following scenario will guide you on how to deploy a "Ready to Go" environment so you can start using Azure Arc enabled data services with Azure PostgreSQL Hyperscale on a [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) cluster by using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

By the end of this guide, you will have a GKE cluster deployed with an Azure Arc Data Controller ([in "Directly Connected" mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/data/connectivity)), Azure PostgreSQL Hyperscale with a sample database and a Microsoft Windows Server 2019 (Datacenter) GKE compute instance VM installed & pre-configured with all the required tools needed to work with Azure Arc data services.

> **Note: Currently, Azure Arc enabled data services is in [public preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/data/release-notes)**.

## Deployment Process Overview

* Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, IAM Role & Service Account
* Download GCP credentials file
* Clone the Azure Arc Jumpstart repository
* Edit *TF_VAR* variables values
* Export *TFVAR* values
* *terraform init*
* *terraform apply*
* Remote into Windows client VM and monitor automation scripts
* Open Azure Data Studio and connect to Postgres instance and sample database
* Run cleanup PowerShell script
* *terraform destroy*

## Prerequisites

* Clone the Azure Arc Jumpstart repository

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc.git
  ```

* [Install or update Azure CLI to version 2.15.0 and above](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest). Use the below command to check your current installed version.

  ```shell
  az --version
  ```

* Google Cloud account with billing enabled - [Create a free trial account](https://cloud.google.com/free). To create Windows Server virtual machines, you must upgraded your account to enable billing. Click Billing from the menu and then select Upgrade in the lower right.

    ***Disclaimer*** - **To prevent unexpected charges, please follow the "Delete the deployment" section at the end of this README**

* [Install Terraform >=0.14](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)

* Create Azure service principal (SP)

  To be able to complete the scenario and its related automation, Azure service principal assigned with the “Contributor” role is required. To create it, login to your Azure account run the below command (this can also be done in [Azure CloudShell](https://shell.azure.com/))

  ```shell
  az login
  az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "<Unique SP Name>" --role contributor
  ```

  For example:

  ```shell
  az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "http://AzureArcData" --role contributor
  ```

  Output should look like this:

  ```json
  {
  "appId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "displayName": "AzureArcData",
  "name": "http://AzureArcData",
  "password": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "tenant": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  }
  ```

  > **Note: It is optional, but highly recommended, to scope the SP to a specific [Azure subscription and resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest).**

* Enable subscription for the Microsoft.AzureArcData resource provider for Azure Arc enabled data services. Registration is an asynchronous process, and registration may take approximately 10 minutes.

  ```shell
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.AzureArcData
  ```

  You can monitor the registration process with the following commands:

  ```shell
  az provider show -n Microsoft.AzureArcData -o table
  ```

* Create a new GCP Project, IAM Role & Service Account. In order to deploy resources in GCP, we will create a new GCP Project as well as a service account to allow Terraform to authenticate against GCP APIs and run the plan to deploy resources.

* Browse to <https://console.cloud.google.com/> and login with your Google Cloud account. Once logged in, [create a new project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) named "Azure Arc Demo". After creating it, be sure to copy down the project id as it is usually different then the project name.

  ![GCP new project](./01.png)

  ![GCP new project](./02.png)

  ![GCP new project](./03.png)

* Enable the Compute Engine API for the project, create a project Owner service account credentials and download the private key JSON file and copy the file to the directory where Terraform files are located. Change the JSON file name (for example *account.json*). The Terraform plan will be using the credentials stored in this file to authenticate against your GCP project.

## Automation Flow

Read the below explanation to get familiar with the automation and deployment flow.

* User edits and exports *TF_VAR* Terraform runtime environment variables (1-time edit). The variable values are used throughout the deployment.

* User deploys the Terraform plan which will deploy a GKE cluster and compute instance VM as well as an Azure resource group. The Azure resource group is required to host the Azure Arc services you will deploy such as Azure Postgres Hyperscale.

* In addition, the plan will copy the *local_ssd_sc.yaml* file which will be used to create a Kubernetes Storage Class backed by SSD disks. These disks will be used by Azure Arc Data Controller to create [persistent volume claims (PVC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/).

  > **Note: Depending on the GCP region, make sure you do not have any [SSD quota limit in the region](https://cloud.google.com/compute/quotas), otherwise, the Azure Arc Data Controller kubernetes resources will fail to deploy.**

* As part of the Windows Server 2019 VM deployment, there are 4 script executions:

  1. *azure_arc.ps1* script will be created automatically as part of the Terraform plan runtime and is responsible for injecting the *TF_VAR* variable values as environment variables on the Windows instance which will then be used in both the *ClientTools* and the *LogonScript* scripts.

  2. *password_reset.ps1* script will be created automatically as part of the Terraform plan runtime and is responsible for creating the Windows username and password.

  3. *ClientTools.ps1* script will run during Terraform plan runtime and will:
      * Create the *ClientTools.log* file  
      * Install the required tools – az cli, az cli Powershell module, kubernetes-cli, Visual C++ Redistributable (Chocolaty packages)
      * Download Azure Data Studio & Azure Data CLI
      * Download the *POSTGRES_HS_Cleanup* and *POSTGRES_HS_Deploy* Powershell scripts
      * Disable Windows Server Manager
      * Create the logon script
      * Create the Windows scheduler task to run the logon script at first login

  4. *LogonScript.ps1* script will run on first login to Windows and will:
      * Create the *LogonScript.log* file
      * Install the Azure Data Studio Azure Data CLI, Azure Arc and PostgreSQL extensions
      * Create the Azure Data Studio desktop shortcut
      * Apply the *local_ssd_sc.yaml* file on the GKE cluster
      * Create the *azdata* config file in user Windows profile
      * Open another Powershell session which will execute a command to watch the deployed Azure Arc Data Controller Kubernetes pods
      * Create Arc Data Controller config file (*control.json*) to setup the use of the Storage Class and Kubernetes LoadBalancer service
      * Deploy the Arc Data Controller using the *TF_VAR* variables values
      * Execute a secondary *Postgres_Connectivity* script which will configure the Postgres instance and download and install the sample Adventureworks database
      * Unregister the logon script Windows scheduler task so it will not run after first login

## Deployment

As mentioned, the Terraform plan will deploy a GKE cluster, the Azure Arc Data Controller on that cluster, a Postgres Hyperscale instance with sample database, and a Windows Server 2019 Client GCP compute instance.

* Before running the Terraform plan, edit the below *TF_VAR* values and export it (simply copy/paste it after you finished edit these). An example *TF_VAR* shell script file is located [here](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_arc_data_jumpstart/gke/postgres_hs/terraform/example/TF_VAR_example.sh)

  ![Terraform vars export](./19.png)

  * *export TF_VAR_gcp_project_id*='Your GCP Project ID (Created in the prerequisites section)'
  * *export TF_VAR_gcp_credentials_filename*='Your GCP Credentials JSON filename (Created in the prerequisites section)'
  * *export TF_VAR_gcp_region*='GCP region where resource will be created'
  * *export TF_VAR_gcp_zone*='GCP zone where resource will be created'
  * *export TF_VAR_gke_cluster_name*='GKE cluster name'

  * *export TF_VAR_windows_username*='Windows Server Client compute instance VM administrator username' **Do not use 'Administrator'**
  * *export TF_VAR_windows_password*='Windows Server Client compute instance VM administrator password' (The password must be at least 8 characters long and contain characters from three of the following four sets: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols as well as **not containing** the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters)
  * *export TF_VAR_SPN_CLIENT_ID*='Your Azure service principal name'
  * *export TF_VAR_SPN_CLIENT_SECRET*='Your Azure service principal password'
  * *export TF_VAR_SPN_TENANT_ID*='Your Azure tenant ID'
  * *export TF_VAR_SPN_AUTHORITY*=*https://login.microsoftonline.com* **Do not change**
  * *export TF_VAR_AZDATA_USERNAME*='Azure Arc Data Controller admin username'
  * *export TF_VAR_AZDATA_PASSWORD*='Azure Arc Data Controller admin password' (The password must be at least 8 characters long and contain characters from three of the following four sets: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols)
  * *export TF_VAR_ARC_DC_NAME*='Azure Arc Data Controller name' (The name must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with a alphanumeric character. This name will be used for k8s namespace as well)
  * *export TF_VAR_ARC_DC_SUBSCRIPTION*='Azure Arc Data Controller Azure subscription ID'
  * *export TF_VAR_ARC_DC_RG*='Azure resource group where all future Azure Arc resources will be deployed'
  * *export TF_VAR_ARC_DC_REGION*='Azure location where the Azure Arc Data Controller resource will be created in Azure' (Currently, supported regions supported are eastus, eastus2, centralus, westus2, westeurope, southeastasia)

    > **Note: If you are running in a PowerShell environment, to set the Terraform environment variables, use the _Set-Item -Path env:_ prefix (see example below)**

    ```powershell
    Set-Item -Path env:TF_VAR_gcp_project_id
    ```

* Navigate to the folder that has Terraform binaries.

  ```shell
  cd azure_arc_data_jumpstart/gke/postgres_hs/terraform
  ```

* Run the ```terraform init``` command which is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files and load the required Terraform providers.

  ![terraform init](./20.png)

* (Optional but recommended) Run the ```terraform plan``` command to make sure everything is configured properly.

  ![terraform plan](./21.png)

* Run the ```terraform apply --auto-approve``` command and wait for the plan to finish. **Runtime for deploying all the GCP resources for this plan is ~20-30min.**

* Once completed, you can review the GKE cluster and the worker nodes resources as well as the GCP compute instance VM created.

## Windows Login & Post Deployment

Now that we have both the GKE cluster and the Windows Server Client instance created, it is time to login to the Client VM.

* Select the Windows instance, click on the RDP dropdown and download the RDP file. Using your *windows_username* and *windows_password* credentials, log in to the VM.

  ![GCP Client VM RDP](./28.png)

  ![GCP Client VM RDP](./29.png)

* At first login, as mentioned in the "Automation Flow" section, a logon script will get executed. This script was created as part of the automated deployment process.

    Let the script to run it's course and **do not close** the PowerShell session, this will be done for you once completed. You will notice that the Azure Arc Data Controller gets deployed on the GKE cluster. **The logon script run time is approximately 10min long**.

    Once the script finishes its run, the logon script PowerShell session will be closed and the Azure Arc Data Controller will be deployed on the GKE cluster and be ready to use.

  <!-- > **Note: Currently, Azure Arc enabled data services is in [public preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/data/release-notes) and features are subject to change. As such, the release being used in this scenario does not support the projection of Azure Arc data services resources in the Azure portal**.

    ![Data Controller in a resource group](./35.png)

    ![Data Controller resource](./36.png) -->

* Another tool automatically deployed is Azure Data Studio along with the *Azure Data CLI*, the *Azure Arc* and the *PostgreSQL* extensions. Azure Data Studio will be opened automatically after the LoginScript is finished. In Azure Data Studio, you can connect to the Postgres instance and see the Adventureworks sample database.

  > **Note: To connect to the Postgres instance use the AZDATA_USERNAME and AZDATA_PASSWORD values specified in the azuredeploy.parameters.json file. The “sa” login is disabled.**

## Cleanup and delete the deployment

* To delete the Postgres instance and Azure Arc Data Controller and all of it's Kubernetes resources, using Administrator rights run the *POSTGRES_HS_Cleanup.ps1* PowerShell script located in *C:\tmp* on the Windows Client instance. At the end of its run, the script will close all PowerShell sessions. **The Cleanup script run time is ~2-3min long**.

  ![DC_Cleanup PowerShell script run](./40.png)

* To finish completely deletimg the environment, follow the below steps run the ```terraform destroy --auto-approve``` command which will delete all of the GCP resources as well as the Azure resource group. **The *terraform destroy* run time is approximately ~5-6min long**.

  ![terraform destroy](./41.png)

## Re-Deploy Azure Arc Data Controller and Postgres instance

* In case you deleted the Azure Arc Data Controller from the GKE cluster, you can re-deploy it by running the *POSTGRES_HS_Deploy.ps1* PowerShell script located in *C:\tmp* on the Windows Client instance. **The Deploy script run time is approximately ~3-4min long**.
